# Basic template for a CMake C++ CUDA project

This project demonstrates a simple example for creating a CUDA project with CMake. We have a very simple 
vector addition example, and we create a single x64-Debug configuration in order to mainly understand, 
how the linking works with CMake and CUDA in Visual Studio.
